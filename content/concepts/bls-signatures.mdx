## Prerequisites

### Digital Signatures

[Digital signatures](/concepts/digital-signatures) support the basic properties of digital signatures: proof that the: 

*   message was sent by the person claiming to send it
*   message has not been tampered with

Private Key + Message = Signature 

Public Key + Message + Signature = Verification 

Verification = SPECIFIC message was sent by SPECIFIC sender

## BLS Signatures

[Boneh–Lynn–Shacham Digital Signatures (BLS signatures)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) are a specific type of digital signature. BLS signatures function perfectly fine (albeit relatively slowly) as standard cryptographic scheme, but the real magic comes from aggregation. 

Aggregation means that given a single message, multiple signatures can be verified with a single operation.

## Signature Aggregation

Technically "signatures" represent a specific point in an elliptic curve and can be "added up." This is a (computationally) easy operation. 

The final result is also a point in the elliptic curve, and is therefore indistinguishable from a non-aggregated signature.

## Public Key Aggregation

Just like a signature, a "public key" is also a point on an elliptic curve and can be similarly "added up" (also computationally easy). 

Once again, aggregated public keys are mathematically indistinguishable from non-aggregated public keys.

## Aggregated Verification

Since aggregate signatures are indistinguishable from normal signatures, and aggregate public keys are indistinguishable from normal public keys, we can reuse our normal verification algorithm. 

Thus, a single operation can verify a huge amount of signatures.

## Benefits of Aggregation

As previously mentioned, BLS signatures are computationally expensive when compared to verifying a more standard scheme - more than an order of magnitude slower. However, each verification can count for MUCH more than a standard scheme (a single verification).

Imagine you need to verify 100 signatures: 

*   Standard digital signature: x time/verification \* 100 verifications = 100x 
*   BLS digital signature: 10x time/verification \* 1 verification = 10x 

The more signatures you can aggregate, the higher the savings

But verification speed is not the only benefit: BLS signatures offer huge space savings over non-aggregated signatures. An aggregated signatures is the same size as a single signature, regardless of how many signatures have been aggregated.

Imagine you need to verify 100 signatures: 

*   Standard digital signature: x bytes/signature \* 100 signatures = 100x 
*   BLS digital signature: x bytes/signature \* 1 signature = x 

More aggregation equals more savings, but even more with space than speed.

BLS signatures are a type of digital signature that provide the same guarantees as any signature (authenticity and liveness) but provide huge scaling benefits when verifying large groups of signatures.
