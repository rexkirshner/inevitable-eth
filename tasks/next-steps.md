## ⏭️ Optional Before Launch (Phase 7.5)

**Timeline:** 5 days (optional)
**Status:** Not blocking deployment, but would improve v1

### Day 1-2: Performance Validation
- [ ] Run Lighthouse CI on production build
- [ ] Test on real mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Verify all 141 articles load correctly
- [ ] Test search performance with large queries
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals in real conditions

### Day 3: Enhanced Navigation
- [ ] Breadcrumbs component
- [ ] Previous/Next article navigation
- [ ] Related articles section (3-5 suggestions)
- [ ] Reading progress indicator

### Day 4: SEO & Migration
- [ ] Wiki.js → new URL redirect map
- [ ] Test redirects preserve SEO
- [ ] RSS/Atom feed generation
- [ ] Verify all metadata is correct

### Day 5: Analytics & Simple Community
- [ ] Plausible or PostHog integration
- [ ] Giscus comments (GitHub Discussions)
- [ ] "Was this helpful?" widget
- [ ] "Edit on GitHub" links

**Decision Point:** Ship now or add these first?
- **Ship now:** Get user feedback ASAP, iterate based on real data
- **Add features:** Polish before launch, but delay learning what users actually need

---

## 📋 Post-Launch Enhancements (Deferred)

**DO NOT BUILD UNTIL v1 IS LIVE AND VALIDATED**

### Phase 8: Enhanced Reading Experience (2 days)
- Article summary boxes
- Enhanced code blocks with copy button
- Collapsible sections
- Better print CSS

### Phase 9: Advanced Community (1 week)
- Article request form
- User feedback widgets
- More robust comments

### Phase 10: Database-Backed Features (2 weeks)
- User submissions system
- Edit approval workflow
- Admin dashboard
- GitHub PR automation

### Phase 11: Interactive Learning (1 week)
- Interactive diagrams (D3.js)
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Learning paths with progress tracking

### Phase 12: PWA & Advanced Performance (3 days)
- Service worker for offline mode
- Push notifications
- Advanced caching strategies

**Why defer?** These add weeks of complexity. Ship v1, gather analytics on what users actually need, then build accordingly.

## 🐛 Known Issues to Monitor

### Non-Critical (Monitor in Production)
1. **Build warnings about metadataBase**
   - Warning: metadata should have metadataBase property
   - Not critical for static export
   - Only matters if using absolute URLs in OG images
   - Can add `metadataBase: 'https://inevitableeth.com'` to root layout if needed

2. **Search index size**
   - Currently 52.36 KB (acceptable)
   - May need optimization if content grows significantly
   - Consider lazy loading full content on search page

3. **Image optimization time**
   - 498 images × 6 variants = ~3,000 files
   - Takes several minutes to run
   - Only needs to run when adding new images
   - Consider CI/CD caching strategy

### No Known Blockers
- ✅ All images loading correctly
- ✅ No broken links
- ✅ All articles rendering
- ✅ Search working
- ✅ Dark mode working
- ✅ Mobile responsive

## 🔄 Maintenance Tasks

### When Adding New Articles
1. Create `.mdx` file in `content/{category}/`
2. Add complete frontmatter (see `lib/content.schema.ts`)
3. Add images to `public/images/`
4. Run `npm run optimize-images` (if new images added)
5. Run `npm run build-search-index` (auto-runs in prebuild)
6. Test locally with `npm run dev`
7. Deploy

### When Updating Images
1. Add new images to `public/images/`
2. Run `npm run optimize-images`
3. Commit optimized versions
4. Deploy

### Regular Maintenance
- **Weekly:** Run `npm run check-links` to catch broken links
- **Monthly:** Review Lighthouse scores
- **Quarterly:** Update dependencies (`npm outdated`, `npm update`)
- **As needed:** Update content, fix typos, improve articles

---

## 💡 Optimization Opportunities

### If Performance Degrades
1. **Images:** Consider CDN for image hosting (Cloudflare Images)
2. **Search:** Move to server-side search if client-side becomes too heavy
3. **Code splitting:** Further optimize bundle sizes
4. **Caching:** Add edge caching strategies

### If Content Grows Significantly (>500 articles)
1. Consider paginated category pages
2. Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
3. Lazy load article previews
4. Server-side search becomes more important

### If Traffic Spikes
1. Cloudflare Pages handles this well (static files)
2. Monitor bandwidth usage
3. Consider adding rate limiting to search
4. Upgrade Cloudflare plan if needed

## 🎯 Immediate Next Action

**Choose your path:**

### Path A: Deploy Now (Recommended)
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Connect Cloudflare Pages
4. Deploy
5. Gather real user data
6. Iterate based on feedback

### Path B: Add Phase 7.5 Features First
1. Pick 2-3 high-value features from Phase 7.5
2. Implement in 2-3 days
3. Test thoroughly
4. Then deploy

**Recommendation:** Deploy now. Every day you wait is a day without real user feedback. You can always add Phase 7.5 features post-launch based on what users actually need.
